# DaktronicsCGSerialParser
Takes serial data from a Daktronics All Sport CG connected to a Daktronics All Sport 5000 scoreboard controller, parses out and formats meaningful data, and writes information to a .csv

If you try to use these, you'll have to hard-code which COM port your All Sport CG is connected to. Currently, the scripts are written for COM7.
